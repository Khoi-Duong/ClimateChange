# Project Overview
For this project

1. Find a problem worth solving, analyzing, or visualizing.

2. Use machine learning (ML) with the technologies we‚Äôve learned.

3. You must use Scikit-learn and/or another machine learning library.

4. Project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

# Climate Change
1. Project Title: 
* Machine Learning To Predict Annual CO2 Emissions

2. Project Description/Outline:
* According to the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, the global goal is to limit the overall increase in global temperature by 1.5‚ÑÉ or less from the average prior to pre-industrial times. Determining how to calculate the starting temperature is controversial, but for the sake of argument, we took the average temperature in our dataset for 1850, which was around 14.87‚ÑÉ or 58.76‚Ñâ. An increase of 1.5‚ÑÉ would be 16.37‚ÑÉ or 61.47‚Ñâ.

3. Research Questions to Answer
* When will the temperature rise to a dangerous level of 16.37 ùáàC /61.47ùáàF?
* When will Earth reach the concerning temperature?

4. Datasets to Be Used

5. Rough Breakdown of Tasks 
* Compared data on temperature, sea level, CO2 emissions, and population from 1993-2015. 
* Create analysis explaining trends of population, CO2 emissions, temperature, and global mean sea level. 
* Leverage machine learning to create a forecast.
* Used sklearn and Prophet along with visualizations.
